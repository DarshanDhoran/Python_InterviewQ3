Python Program to Convert Lists to Dictionary and Dictionary to Tuples := 

1. Convert Two Lists into a Dictionary
The list_to_dict function takes two lists, Name_list1 (containing names) and Phone_list2 (containing phone numbers).
It uses the zip function to pair each element from Name_list1 with its corresponding element in Phone_list2 and then converts this paired data into a dictionary using the dict() function.

2. Convert Dictionary to Tuples
The dict_to_tuple function takes a dictionary x and uses the .items() method to get the key-value pairs as tuples.
The program then iterates over these items and prints each key-value pair as a tuple.
